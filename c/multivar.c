/*
The general rules for naming variables are:

Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names*/
